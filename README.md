# OperatingSystems-Project

By:Ade Dokhan

Introduction:
in this Project i made a grade server that storest grades for all students and allows clients to read and modify the grades,there is 2 types of clients and each client has different privileges and access to files. 

1)Student client that can only read his grade

2)Teaching Assistant client that can read all of the grades and modify them.

so i created user mode applications and TCP Server-Client from scratch using C programing lanuage the communicates through the terminal with additional features such as server getting commands from the client and checks privileges for this client,reads from specific files and serves the client back.
